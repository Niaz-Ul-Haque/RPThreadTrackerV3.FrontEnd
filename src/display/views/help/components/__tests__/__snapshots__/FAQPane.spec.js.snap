      <h4>
        Why am I seeing a "Not Found" error for my post?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The following are several potential causes/fixes for this issue:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure you have not mistyped your blog name or post ID, and that
           
          you are using a post ID from a post on the tracked blog.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have recently changed your blog URL on Tumblr, you will have
           
          to update it in the tracker as well, via the “Manage Blogs” screen, before
           
          the tracker can find your threads again.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have made your blog private only to Tumblr users (i.e. the switch
           
          in your blog settings that says "Allow logged-out users to see this blog"
           
          is turned off), your blog will also be private to the API which the tracker
           
          uses, and thus your posts cannot be retrieved by the tracker unless you make
           
          your blog public again.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you see many/all threads displaying this issue at once, it’s likely a Tumblr
           
          bug and will pass shortly; feel free to let me know what’s happening by sending me
           
          an ask, so I can post an announcement if I haven’t already.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        Why can't I track open starters on Tumblr?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, due to the way Tumblr structures its information, RPThreadTracker cannot
         
        distinguish between different "branches" from an original post; Tumblr considers
         
        them all part of the same thread of interaction so the tracker can't monitor them individually.
         
        In order to track separate threads from an open starter you will have to move each interaction
         
         to its own base post and then track that.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Why doesn't the 
        <a
          href="/tools"
        >
          Export Threads
        </a>
         tool include post dates and whose turn it is?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The export tool is intended as a way to download a full list of your threads during a period when
         
        the Tracker isn't performing its usual function for some reason (i.e. during a Tumblr outage),
         
        so it's intended to be a pretty lightweight process. Adding calls to Tumblr would make
         
        export process more resource intensive and take a lot longer, and assuming the tracker's
         
        connection with Tumblr is stable, you can get the same information from the usual thread
         
        tables.
